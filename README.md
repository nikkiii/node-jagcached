# node-jagcached
An OnDemand File Server for Jagex Filesystems written in Javascript.

It is experimental and probably not the best. It also lacks a proper license, as I am unsure which license would be compatible as it uses code from the original JagCached and also node packages.

I'd assume GPLv3 would cover it just fine, however.
